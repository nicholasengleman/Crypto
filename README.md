# Cryptocurrency Filter and Summerizer

(my first react project)

## Features
### Homepage:
- Sort cryptocurrencies by Market Cap, Price, 1-hour Percent Change, 24-Hour Percent Change, 7-Day Percent Change or 24-Hour Volume
- Filter cryptocurrencies by same attributes, returning only those where the data is above x, below y or between x and y
- Combine multiple filters together to further refine your search

### Individual Crypto Pages:
- TradingView.com chart locked to that symbol
- short descrption of the cryptocurrency with link for more info
- list of upcoming events related to that cryptocurrency, with links to view original source info, as well as event on Kryptocal.com
- button to add an event on to Kryptocal.com


## To-Do
1. add more summary data
2. add individual buttons on homepage that link directly to a crypto's chart, events or data
